We define the following terms:

Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows: 
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.
Given a string, , and an integer, , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length .

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting . 
The second line contains an integer denoting .

Constraints

 consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).
Output Format

Return the respective lexicographically smallest and largest substrings as a single newline-separated string.

Explanation 0

String  has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length :

We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).

The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.

#CODE


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static String getSmallestAndLargest(String s, int k) {
        String smallest = s.substring(0, k);
        String largest = s.substring(0, k);
        for(int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++){
                String sm;                  
                sm = s.substring(i, i+k);
                if(sm.compareTo(largest) > 0)
                    largest = sm;
                if(sm.compareTo(smallest) < 0)
                    smallest = sm;
        }
        
        return smallest + "\n" + largest;
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scan.next();
        int k = scan.nextInt();
        scan.close();
      
        System.out.println(getSmallestAndLargest(s, k));
    }
